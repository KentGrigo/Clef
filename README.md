# Clef
## What is this?
The is an implementation of the imperative programming language, Clef.

## Status
Currently, there is only an AST and an interpreter for a simple subset of the language.
We support
- Basic type (Interger, Bool, Variables)
- arithmatics (+, -, *, /)
- Functions
- Conditions (if, <, <=, ==)
- Assignment (function, variable)
- Statements

## How to run?
The `main` method in `Runner` has some examples on how to construct programs based on the AST and how to run the interpreter.
